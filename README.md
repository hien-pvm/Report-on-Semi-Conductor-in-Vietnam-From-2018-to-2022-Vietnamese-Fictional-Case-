## VI. Conclusion
Vietnam's semiconductor industry faces significant challenges due to political and social factors during 2018-2022 period (e.g., COVID-19, U.S.-China trade war). However, the industry's increasing revenue and profit growth indicate substantial development potential.<br />
<br />
To sustain growth, the industry must leverage its existing competitive advantages while enhancing collaboration with international firms for technology transfer and technical advancements. Key priorities include infrastructure investment, high-quality workforce development, a robust legal framework, and stronger international partnerships (Bá Tân & Bùi Tấn, 2022).
